About this document
The Medicare Code Editor (MCE) detects and reports errors in the coding claims data. This manual contains a description of each coding edit with corresponding ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS code lists. 
The coding edit information in this manual is effective from 10/01/2013 to 09/30/2014. However it is not intended to be used to process claims as the ICD-10 code set will not be mandated for use until the implementation of ICD-10.

19. Procedure inconsistent with LOS


1. Invalid diagnosis or procedure code
The Medicare Code Editor checks each diagnosis including the admitting diagnosis and each procedure against a table of valid ICD codes. If an entered code does not agree with any code on the internal list, it is assumed to be invalid. 
For a list of all valid ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes, see the International Classification of Diseases list.
2. External causes of morbidity codes as principal diagnosis
External cause codes (V, W, X or Y codes) describe the circumstance causing an injury, not the nature of the injury, and therefore should not be used as a principal diagnosis. 
For a list of all external causes of morbidity codes, see the International Classification of Diseases list.
3. Duplicate of PDX
Whenever a secondary diagnosis is coded the same as the principal diagnosis, the secondary diagnosis is identified as a duplicate of the principal diagnosis. 
4. Age conflict
The Medicare Code Editor detects inconsistencies between a patient’s age and any diagnosis on the patient’s record. For example, a five-year-old patient with benign prostatic hypertrophy or a 78-year-old patient coded with a delivery.
In the above cases, the diagnosis is clinically and virtually impossible in a patient of the stated age. Therefore, either the diagnosis or the age is presumed to be incorrect. There are four age categories for diagnoses in the program.
* Newborn. Age of 0 years; a subset of diagnoses intended only for newborns and neonates (e.g., fetal distress, perinatal jaundice). 
* Pediatric. Age range is 0–17 years inclusive (e.g., Reye’s syndrome, routine child health exam). 
* Maternity. Age range is 12–55 years inclusive (e.g., diabetes in pregnancy, antepartum pulmonary complication). 
* Adult. Age range is 15–124 years inclusive (e.g., senile delirium, mature cataract).  
The following pages contain lists of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes with corresponding English descriptions for each of the age categories described above.

5. Sex conflict
Medicare Code Editor detects inconsistencies between a patient’s sex and any diagnosis or procedure on the patient’s record. For example, a male patient with cervical cancer (diagnosis) or a female patient with a prostatectomy (procedure).
In both instances, the indicated diagnosis or the procedure conflicts with the stated sex of the patient. Therefore, either the patient’s diagnosis, procedure or sex is presumed to be incorrect.
The following pages contain lists of files for male and female related ICD-10-CM diagnosis and ICD-10-PCS procedure codes with corresponding English descriptions.

6. Manifestation code as principal diagnosis
Manifestation codes describe the manifestation of an underlying disease, not the disease itself, and therefore should not be used as a principal diagnosis.
The following list contains ICD-10-CM diagnoses with corresponding English descriptions identified as manifestation codes.

7. Non-specific principal diagnosis
Effective 10/01/07, the non-specific principal diagnosis edit was discontinued and will appear for claims processed using MCE version 2.0–23.0 only.
8. Questionable admission
Some diagnoses are not usually sufficient justification for admission to an acute care hospital. For example, if a patient is given code R030 for elevated blood pressure reading, without diagnosis of hypertension, then the patient would have a questionable admission, since elevated blood pressure reading is not normally sufficient justification for admission to a hospital.
The following list contains diagnosis codes with corresponding English descriptions identified as questionable admission when used as a principal diagnosis.
Questionable admission codes

E139   	Other specified diabetes mellitus without complications

9. Unacceptable principal diagnosis
There are selected codes that describe a circumstance which influences an individual’s health status but not a current illness or injury, or codes that are not specific manifestations but may be due to an underlying cause. These codes are considered unacceptable as a principal diagnosis.
The following unacceptable principal diagnosis code is considered "acceptable" when a secondary diagnosis is also coded on the record. If no secondary diagnosis is present for this code, the message REQUIRES SECONDARY DX will appear:
Z5189	Encounter for other specified aftercare
Note: This code is identified with an asterisk.
The following pages contain a list of codes with corresponding English descriptions identified as unacceptable when entered as principal diagnosis.
Unacceptable principal diagnosis codes
B6013	Keratoconjunctivitis due to Acanthamoeba
